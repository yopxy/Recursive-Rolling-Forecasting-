# Macroeconometrics Forecasting of Swedish Inflation -
Rolling /Recursive forecasting
This project investigates the predictive performance of the machine learning model by forecasting Swedish inflation.
This study examines the effectiveness of the five chosen models in terms of inflation prediction.
The five models include the random walk, ARIMA, lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression. 
The error-based assessment measures determine the best model for forecasting Sweden's inflation. 
The evaluation metrics used to compare the performances of these models are mean squared error and mean absolute error. 
Then, the elastic net yields more accurate predictions for all forecasting horizons than the benchmark test.
